                <p>
                Hi my name is Rett! I'm currently an undergraduate studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan. 
                I transfered here from a small insitution called Northwestern Community College (NMC) where I studied for my ASA associates degree.
                During my time enrolled I took classes dominated in mathamatics and sciences with ambitions of an ultimate goal to relocate to Ann Arbor. 
                My passion is to effiently solve solutions to problems using problem-solving and crictal thinking skills -- which is why I love engineering. 
                I chose computer science because it has exactly those qualities while also allowing creativity at your figure-tip by opening up a computer. At
                the Univeristy of Michigan I have been involved in multiple entreprenurship clubs and events as well as driven to completed personal and in-class projects.

                            <p>Inspired by my statistic and linear algebra courses. I designed this project using Python for the purpose of 
                                learning data extraction from websites, data cleaning, visualizing data, and creating a linear regression
                                model for an introduction to machine learning. I wanted to see if taking a few key statistics from
                                NBA Games is sufficent to predict the final score of NBA games.</p>

                            <p>I took a few key statistics from all 2022 NBA regular season games: 3P%, 
                                FT%, ORB, STL, TOV. I used a dataset of the key statistics and the final score. 
                                I split the data into a train and test dataset.  I used the key statistics and final scores 
                                form the train dataset to make trained model. For the test dataset, I removed the final scores and kept the key statistics.</p>

                            <p>Created a NBA players database using ReactJS for the fontend, Python for the backend, and SQLite for the database management.
                                The propose of the project was to use the skills I've learned about web systems and apply them. The 
                                database sorts by columns and also can search for 1 or more different attributes for players in the database. 
                                The project accounts for players being traded, added, or removed from the leauge by the database refreshing 
                                everytime the website is refreshed.</p>

                                we had 48 hours to complete a game from scatch. I joined late so I worked on this game alone. 
                                The game is called Battle Conquest where you go through infinite waves of enemies and can upgrade your character throughout the game.
                                The goal is to get to the fruthest level and see how mch you can upgrade your player. 
                                This project aims help me futher understand my knowledge of classes in the C++ langauge.</p>

                            <p>During my time with of NOME lab I was tasked with a personal project to automate the process of
                                extracting sclaebar measurements from mircoscopic cavity images. There were steps I implemented to find the scalebar data.
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Find max length of pixels with same hue and zoom-in on top candidate.</li>
                                <li>Use EAST algorithm to find the text near the scalebar.</li>
                                <li>Use OCR to extract the measurement and units.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>EAST algorithm is used to find letters, numbers, and symbols in an image. While
                            OCR is a process used to extract the letters, numbers, and symbols from the images and put them in a string.</p>

                            <p>However, having multiple different variations of images such as previously labeled information, led to this process producing some unwanted outcomes.
                                The next step in the process was rather than using the EAST algorithm I would implement a machine learning model to find the sclaebar and its measuement.
