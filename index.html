                I am Rett, a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Michigan. My passion for efficiency and problem-solving 
                led me to choose computer science. Through active involvement in clubs, labs, and internships, I gained practical experience 
                and a learn-by-doing mindset. Below you can view some of my personal projects along with other experiences I have had. In the end, 
                I aspire to leverage code for meaningful and positive impacts on others.

                                As a director, I collaborate closely with the Center for Entrepreneurship to organize an 
                                Innovation Challenge event, attracting 100+ students from all 19 colleges within the university. 
                                Additionally, I successfully contributed to the success of the Start-Up Career Fair, leveraging my skills to cold email and 
                                foster meaningful connections with various companies, aiming to secure their participation in the event.
