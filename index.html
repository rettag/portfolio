              <div id="about-content">
                I am Rett, a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Michigan. My passion for efficiency and problem-solving 
                led me to choose computer science. Through active involvement in clubs, labs, and internships, I gained practical experience 
                and a learn-by-doing mindset. Below you can view some of my personal projects along with other experiences I have had. In the end, 
                I aspire to leverage code for meaningful and positive impacts on others.

                                The NOME lab, housed within the Nuclear Engineering department at the University of Michigan. The department has been ranked #1 in the world for nuclear engineering.
                                During my time at the NOME lab, I developed a image-processing algorithm that automates the extraction of scale-bar image data, significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of future lab implementations.
                                Additionally, I successfully managed a comprehensive database comprising 250+ scale-bar images, providing a valuable resource for ongoing research and analysis within the lab.
                                By implementing my algorithm, the NOME lab has witnessed improved productivity, reduced manual effort, and minimized potential errors, allowing researchers to focus on critical aspects of their work.

                                I am a fellow of the Entrepreneur Leadership Program, a prestigious initiative that offers intensive 
                                training and mentorship to a handpicked group of students. This exclusive program aims to cultivate exceptional 
                                functional, managerial, and leadership skills, setting apart the truly outstanding entrepreneurs from the rest. 
                                While part of ELP, I have been fortunate to receive a comprehensive experiential curriculum that empowers me to 
                                pursue an entrepreneurial path both during and after my college career at the University of Michigan. I am currently 
                                part of Cohort 8, an esteemed group comprising 20-25 students, selected from an acceptance rate of less than 15%. 
                                Being a part of ELP allows me to delve deep into the qualities and characteristics that define great entrepreneurs and leaders.
